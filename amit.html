    <h2>About :</h2>
    <p>Amit Singhal is a former senior vice president at Google Inc. having been a Google Fellow and the head of Google's Search team for 15 years.
        Born in Jhansi, a city in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India,[7] Singhal received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in computer science from IIT Roorkee in 1989.[8] He continued his computer science education in the United States, and received an M.S. degree from University of Minnesota Duluth in 1991.[9] He wrote about his time at the University of Minnesota Duluth.
        Singhal continued his studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and received a Ph.D. degree in 1996.[9] At Cornell, Singhal studied with Gerard Salton, a pioneer in the field of information retrieval, the academic discipline which forms the foundation of modern search. John Battelle, in his book The Search, calls Gerard Salton "the father of digital search." After getting a Ph.D. in 1996, Singhal joined AT&T Labs (previously a part of Bell Labs), where he continued his research in information retrieval, speech retrieval and other related fields.
